# Grid-Based Pheromone Optimization Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates a 5x5 grid where an intelligent agent interacts with balls and holes. The agent's task is to find and move balls to holes using a pheromone-based approach, inspired by ant colony optimization. The agent starts with no prior knowledge of the grid and must explore its surroundings to complete the task within a limited number of moves.

## Features

- 5x5 grid with randomly placed balls and holes.
- Agent capable of moving in four cardinal directions.
- Agent can pick up balls and place them into holes.
- Limited to 30 movements due to battery constraints.
- Dynamic grid size, ball, and hole configuration.
